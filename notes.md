# todo

## research paper
how to enjoy life. So it can be better. (for the book in kindle Jin Jing)

## data structure define
Ans: just input as lines of text describing what we have done today, it will be put to structured relational database, output graph data(a presentation)

## client restful API
it could do thing for us (retrieve data for yout)

## we will need a datastorage thing. we just use mariadb. For this we just do pure sql, as I am learing this

# todo
- simple example.
- pipline needs do work first.
- script for test local (faster loop)
- let CI run normal tests
- add document generation
- image generation part( some message queue can be use, to view real time data) (knowledge graph)
- grading part
- ide for input(later), we just use nlp first, should be easier
- learn from bill board grammer, then just do it with antlr. For basic dataset operation, just a wrapper for SQL. Or we just add new items automatically.
- after we parsed our input, we put it to related dataset, then data analysis.
