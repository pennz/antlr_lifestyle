Important notes:
What is needed? needed in life


# landing pages
- Added thoughts
- todo
- Daily/weekly review. show statics. analyze. or KANBAN system. or we use another thing 

API , different parts of life.

# Project todo

## research paper
how to enjoy life. So it can be better. (for the book in kindle Jin Jing)

## data structure define
Ans: just input as lines of text describing what we have done today, it will be put to structured relational database, output graph data(a presentation)

## client restful API (external)
it could do thing for us (retrieve data for yout)

## we will need a datastorage thing. we just use mariadb. For this we just do pure sql, as I am learing this

- simple example.
- pipline needs do work first.
- script for test local (faster loop)
- let CI run normal tests
- add document generation
- image generation part( some message queue can be use, to view real time data) (knowledge graph)
- grading part
- ide for input(later), we just use nlp first, should be easier
- learn from bill board grammar, then just do it with antlr. For basic dataset operation, just a wrapper for SQL. Or we just add new items automatically.
- after we parsed our input, we put it to related dataset, then data analysis.

# Internal Implementation
## go and python
[data dog page introducing about the inter-operation](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/cgo-and-python/)
Just python pool and save to database [YOU PROBABLY DONâ€™T NEED A MESSAGE QUEUE by Bozho](https://techblog.bozho.net/you-probably-dont-need-a-message-queue/)

So answer: just run scheduled tasks. Not go calling python... Not
over-complicate it. Not easy to maintain.

## parse by python, and then send it back to our go API?
DODODO

## Message queue or not
Queue: let python handle inputed sentences, and put it to handled ones. The un-handled 
ones can be leave there for analysis.
Just like UDP.

Anyway,  we need parse out our input, and put it to dataset. Or read it out from 
dataset, then back to dataset.

## for display
Follow datadog agent? Go just call python module?

We use Javascript thing to show graph (html tools is more available, interactive graphs)

# Components
client: flutter for input of sentences (https better), output of the graph/statistics
server: highcharts export server (only for UI) + nlp handling (nlp use python scapy) + (go or python? save to ) dataset
